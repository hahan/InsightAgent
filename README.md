# InsightAgent
InsightFinder agents can be used to monitor system performance on bare-metal machines, virtual machines, and containers.

See the individual agent folders for installation and setup instructions.
In general, agent installers assume that the following programs are installed:
* `wget`
* `python`
* `monit`
    * Not required for all agents
    * Assumes that files in `/etc/monit.d/` are included in the config
